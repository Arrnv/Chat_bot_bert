# BERT-based Chatbot

## Overview

This project demonstrates the development of a **chatbot** using **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**, a transformer-based model for natural language understanding and generation. The chatbot utilizes BERT to process user input, understand context, and generate appropriate responses, making it an efficient and context-aware solution for conversational systems.

The system follows an **encoder-decoder architecture**, where BERT is used as the encoder to process input sentences and a simple decoder is used to generate responses. This project leverages transfer learning, where BERT is fine-tuned on a specific dataset of question-answer pairs to optimize its conversational performance.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following dependencies:

- **Python 3.x**
- **TensorFlow** (2.x recommended)
- **Transformers** (from Hugging Face)
- **Keras**
- **Numpy**
- **Pandas**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib** (for visualization)

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow transformers numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following key components:

- **BERT-based chatbot architecture**: This includes the model's encoder-decoder structure using BERT.
- **Dataset**: A custom dataset of question-answer pairs to fine-tune BERT for generating responses.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: This notebook contains the code, explanations, and visualizations for the chatbot system.

## How to Run

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository to your local machine or Google Colab environment:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

### Step 2: Load the Dataset

The notebook will guide you on loading a custom dataset consisting of conversational question-answer pairs. You can use your own dataset or one available online.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load your custom dataset (ensure it has 'question' and 'answer' columns)
data = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')
```

### Step 3: Fine-Tuning BERT

The BERT model is pre-trained and then fine-tuned on the dataset to learn the conversational context. This step may take some time depending on the dataset size and hardware specifications.

```python
from transformers import TFBertForSequenceClassification, BertTokenizer

# Load the BERT model and tokenizer
model = TFBertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

# Fine-tune the model on your dataset
# (Implementation will involve setting up training data and optimizer)
```

### Step 4: Model Evaluation and Testing

After fine-tuning, the model is tested on sample input queries to evaluate its response quality. The chatbot uses BERTâ€™s encoder to understand the context and generate a suitable response.

```python
def generate_response(input_text):
    inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors='tf')
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    response = tokenizer.decode(outputs.logits.argmax(-1), skip_special_tokens=True)
    return response

# Test the chatbot
input_query = "How can I help you today?"
response = generate_response(input_query)
print(response)
```

### Step 5: Running the Chatbot

Once fine-tuned, you can start an interactive session where the user can input queries, and the chatbot will respond accordingly.

```python
while True:
    user_input = input("You: ")
    if user_input.lower() == 'exit':
        break
    response = generate_response(user_input)
    print(f"Chatbot: {response}")
```

## Model Evaluation

The chatbot's performance is evaluated on several metrics, including:

- **Accuracy**: Correctness of responses based on a test set.
- **Response Quality**: Subjective evaluation based on how well the model's responses match human-like conversations.
- **Contextual Understanding**: Evaluation of how well the model captures the context and nuances of the conversation.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of **BERT** in building an intelligent, context-aware **chatbot** that can understand and generate natural language responses. By leveraging **transfer learning**, we minimize the need for large labeled datasets, making the model efficient and adaptable to various domains.

## Notes

- This project is designed to be flexible, allowing you to replace the dataset and model configurations to experiment with different conversational domains.
- The implementation can be further improved by adding attention mechanisms or fine-tuning on more sophisticated dialogue datasets.
